## Introduction
The Reader Project is a web-based RSS feed aggregator inspired by the calm and analogue feel of e-ink devices. It simplifies the process of discovering, saving, and reading RSS feeds from hundreds of well-known, reliable sources. With a clean, grayscale interface, minimal distractions, and easy navigation, the Reader Project provides a serene and focused reading experience.

## Features
- **Massive Curated Feed Library**: Choose from a large selection of pre-suggested feeds spanning news, tech, design, science, and more.
- **E-Ink Inspired UI**: A grayscale, paper-like design that feels like reading on an e-ink device.
- **Feed Discovery & Management**: Instantly fetch new feeds by URL or pick from suggested ones. Save, favorite, and refresh feeds on-demand.
- **Master-Detail Navigation**: Click a feed to view its items, then select an article to slide in a detailed content panelâ€”no disruptive pop-ups.
- **Inline Notifications & Actions**: Enjoy toast messages for feedback, inline confirmations for feed removal, and a simple star icon for favorites.
